# vudata

Set up project structure and dependencies (Python/Streamlit, YAML parsing libraries)
Create binary management module (start/stop/restart vuDataSim with timeout control)
Implement YAML-safe reader for conf.d/conf.yml (preserve formatting for module toggles)
Build module browser component (list folders in conf.d/, show module status)
Create module configuration editor (edit uniquekey.NumUniqKey and period in module conf.yml)
Implement submodule browser and editor (edit uniquekey.NumUniqKey in submodule files)
Build EPS calculation engine (implement the formula with module and submodule unique keys)
Create manual tuning interface (sliders/inputs with live EPS preview)
Implement auto-tuner algorithm (calculate required unique keys for target EPS)
Add diff preview system (show YAML changes before saving)
Create backup and rollback functionality (automatic backups with restore capability)
Build main Streamlit UI layout (dashboard, navigation, responsive design)
Add logging and audit trail (track all changes and binary operations)
Create file validation and conflict detection (prevent concurrent modification issues)
Add testing framework and sample data validation


ased on my analysis of your configuration structure and the clarifications you provided, I've created a comprehensive plan for the vuDataSim web UI. Here's the system architecture:

ðŸ‘¤ User

Streamlit Web UI

Python Backend Logic

UI Layout & Navigation

YAML Safe Editor

Binary Process Manager

EPS Calculation Engine

Auto-Tuner Algorithm

Diff Preview System

Backup & Rollback

Audit & Logging

Module Toggle: conf.d/conf.yml

Module Config Editor

Submodule Config Editor

Start/Stop/Restart vuDataSim

Duration & Timeout Control

Process Status Monitoring

File System: conf.d/

Backups: .bak.timestamp

vuDataSim Binary

Key Architecture Decisions
Technology Stack:

Frontend: Streamlit (as requested - clean UI, can handle live data visualization)
Backend: Python with strict YAML processing
YAML Handling: Custom token-based editing to preserve formatting and comments
Process Management: Python subprocess with proper signal handling
Core Safety Features:

Atomic writes with temporary files and backups
Concurrent modification detection using file checksums
Token-level YAML editing to preserve formatting/comments
Comprehensive validation before any file changes
Data Flow:

Module Toggle: conf.d/conf.yml â†’ Parse â†’ Toggle boolean â†’ Validate â†’ Backup â†’ Write
Config Edit: Module/Submodule .yml â†’ Parse â†’ Edit NumUniqKey/period â†’ Calculate EPS â†’ Preview â†’ Save
Binary Control: Launch vuDataSim â†’ Monitor process â†’ Timeout/Stop â†’ Log results
Development Phases
Phase 1: Foundation (Tasks 1-3)

Project setup and YAML-safe parsing
Binary process management
Basic module toggling
Phase 2: Core Features (Tasks 4-8)

Module/submodule browser and editors
EPS calculation engine
Manual tuning interface
Phase 3: Advanced Features (Tasks 9-11)

Auto-tuner algorithm
Diff preview and backup system
Enhanced UI and validation
Phase 4: Polish (Tasks 12-15)

Main UI layout and testing
Audit logging and conflict detection
Final validation and documentation
